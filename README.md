# Technical Details
Boost Simulation Algorithm
DiscordBoostMaster employs a state-of-the-art simulation algorithm to mimic user interactions with the Discord API. While it may appear as though boosts are being executed without any associated costs, it's important to note that this is purely fictional and doesn't have any real impact on server boosting status.

1. API Interaction Emulation
DiscordBoostMaster simulates API requests in a way that closely resembles authentic interactions with the Discord server. It crafts requests that give the illusion of boosting a server while maintaining the appearance of an untouched boost count.

2. Session Manipulation
To maintain the appearance of an unused boost, DiscordBoostMaster subtly manipulates the session data, creating a temporary environment where the Discord API believes boosts haven't been utilized.
